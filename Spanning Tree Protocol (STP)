Spanning Tree Protocol
The spanning tree protocol is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet Networks. The basic
fucntion of STP is to prevent bridge loops(switch) and the broadcast radiation that results from them. Spanning tree also allows
a network design to include backup links providing fault tolerance if an active link fails.

Types of STP:

Spanning Tree Operation:
1. Determine the Root Bridge- the bridge advertising the lowest bridge ID becomes the root bridge
2. Select Root Port- each bridge selects its primary port facing the root
3. Select Designated Ports- one designated port is selected per segment
4. Block Ports with Loops- all non-root and non-designated ports are blocked

Port States:
Legacy ST- Disabled, Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding
Rapid ST- Discarding, Learning, Forwarding

Port Roles:
Legacy ST- Root, Designated, Blocking
Rapid ST- Root, Designated, Alternate, Backup

Default Timers:
Hello: 2sec
Forward Delay: 15sec
Max Age: 20sec

Bandwidth:                       Cost:

10Mbps                           100
16Mbps                           62
45Mbps                           39
100Mbps                          19
155Mbps                          14
622Mbps                          6
1Gbps                            4
10Gbps                           2
20+Gbps                          1

Path Selection:
1. Bridge with lowest root ID becomes the root
2. Prefer the neighbor with the lowest cost to root
3. Prefer the neighbor with the loweset bridge ID
4. Prefer the lowest sender port ID

PVST+ and RPVST+ Configuration
!set mode
spanning-tree mode {pvst | rapid-pvst}

!Bridge Priority
spanning-tree vlan <1-4094> priority <0-61440> (must be in increments of 4096 and default is 32768)

!Timers, in seconds. I listed default 
spanning-tree vlan <1-4094> hello-time 2<seconds>
spanning-tree vlan <1-4094> forward-time 15<seconds>
spanning-tree vlan <1-4096> max-age 20<seconds>

!PVST+ Enhancements
spanning-tree backbonefast (Enables immediate expiration of max age timer in the event of an indirect link failure)
spanning-tree uplinkfast (Enables switches to maintain backup paths to root)

! Interface Enhancements, Defaults listed
spanning-tree [vlan 1-4096] port-priority 128 <0-240>
spanning-tree [vlan 1-4096] cost 19 <1-200,000,000> (default cost depends on the type of link in this example its a 100Mbps switchport. See table above)

!Manual Link Type Specification                     
spanning-tree link-type {point-to-point | shared} (Point-to-Point-Connects to exactly one other bridge[Full-duplex]. Shared potentially connects to multiple bridges[Half-duplex]. Edge connects to a single host; designated by Portfast)

!Enables Portfast if running PVST+, or designates and edgeport under RPVST+
spanning-tree portfast (skips listening/discarding states and goes straight to forwarding.)

!Spanning tree protection
spanning-tree gaurd {loop | root | none}

!Per-interface toggling
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
spanning-tree bpdufilter enable

Spanning Tree Protection:
Root Guard: Prevents a port from becoming the root port
BPDU Guard: Error-Disables a port if a BPDU is received
Loop Guard: Prevents a blocked port from transitioning to listening after the Max Age timer has expiredf
BPDU Filter: Blocks BPDu's on an interface (disables STP)

MST Configuration:
spanning-tree mode mst
