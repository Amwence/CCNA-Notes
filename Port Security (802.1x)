 You can use the port security feature to restrict input to an interface by limiting and identifying MAC addresses of the workstations that are allowed to access the port. When you assign secure MAC addresses to a secure port, the port does not forward packets with source addresses outside the group of defined addresses. If you limit the number of secure MAC addresses to one and assign a single secure MAC address, the workstation attached to that port is assured the full bandwidth of the port.

If a port is configured as a secure port and the maximum number of secure MAC addresses is reached, when the MAC address of a workstation attempting to access the port is different from any of the identified secure MAC addresses, a security violation occurs.

After you have set the maximum number of secure MAC addresses on a port, the secure addresses are included in an address table in one of these ways:

•You can configure all secure MAC addresses by using the switchport port-security mac-address mac_address interface configuration command.

•You can allow the port to dynamically configure secure MAC addresses with the MAC addresses of connected devices.

•You can configure a number of addresses and allow the rest to be dynamically configured.
