Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)
Supports arbitrary load balancing in addition to redundancy across gateways; Cisco Proprietary

GLBP Roles:
Active Virtual Gateway (AVG)
Answers for the virutal router and assigns virtual MAC addresses to the group
Active Virtual Forwarder (AVF)
All routers which forward traffic for the group

GLBP Load Balancing: 
Round Robin (default)
The AVG answers host ARP requests for the virtual router with the nest router in the cycle
Host-Dependent
Round-robin cycling is used while a consistent AVF is maintained for each host
Weighted
Deterimines the proportionate share of hosts handled by each AVF

GLBP Configuration:
interface FastEthernet 0/0
ip address 10.0.1.2 255.255.255.0
glbp 1 ip 10.0.1.1 (sets virtual IP for GLBP)
glbp 1 timers redirect <redirect> <time-out>
glbp 1 priority <priority>
glbp 1 preempt
glbp 1 forwarder preempt
glbp 1 authentication md5 key-string <password>
glbp 1 load-balancing <method> ( Round-Robin[default], Host-Dependent, Weighted)
glbp 1 weighting <weight> lower <lower> upper <upper>
glbp 1 weighting track <object> decrement <value>
