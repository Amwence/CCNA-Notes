# Routing Terminology:

**AS-Autonomous system**: Is a grouping of networks under a single administrative domain.(AS system is under control of a group of people/company. So like coke/pepsi would have 2 different AS)

**IGP**- Interior Gateway protocol (within an AS: RIP, EIGRP, OSPF): Within an AS

**EGP**- Exterior Gateway Protocol (BGP or Border Gateway Protocol): Used between AS's

Before using BGP you need to register an Autonomous System Number. There are private numbers you can use withan an AS(like a private IP address).

# Autonomous System Numbers:

Within an AS no need to register or apply for an AS (within the network)

When communicating on the internet: Apply for an AS member(provided by an ISP)

**Public Autonomous System Number**

**Private Autonomous System Number**
