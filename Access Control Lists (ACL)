Access control list- Access control lists (ACLs) perform packet filtering to control which packets move through a network and to where. The packet filtering provides security by helping to limit the network traffic, restrict the access of users and devices to a network, and prevent the traffic from leaving a network. IP access lists reduce the chance of spoofing and denial-of-service attacks and allow dynamic, temporary user-access through a firewall.

IP access lists can also be used for purposes other than security, such as bandwidth control, restrict the content of routing updates, redistribute routes, trigger dial-on-demand (DDR) calls, limit debug output, and identify or classify traffic for quality of service (QoS) features. This module provides an overview of IP access lists.

Inbound and Outbound traffic is based on the port it is being acted upon. For example when making an ACL from a laptop going through a router, and to a server. The port that the laptop is connected to the router. Anything being sent from the laptop to that port would be inbound traffic, and anything coming out of that port to the pc would be outbound traffic. Same for the server side of this example. The port that the server directly connects to any traffic coming from the server into the router would be inbound, and anything being sent out of that port to the server would be outbound traffic. It is all based on the port you are putting the ACL on.
