Router makes routing decisions based upon what is in it's FIB/Route table, or Forwarding information base. If there is more than one entry for an IP address it first decides to take the path with the longest network match. If they are equal then it makes decisions based upon administrative distance. For Example:
if I wanted to go to 10.1.1.2/24 and there were multiple routes in the table: 10.0.0.0/8, 10.1.0.0/16 and 10.1.1.0/24 and 10.1.1.0/30 it would take the /30 route because that has the longest network match, because it has 30 network bits. Similarly if the only path is 10.0.0.0/8 and there are multiple routing protocols giving different paths it would go by the lowest administrative distance.

Admin Distance:
Connected: 0
Static: 1
EBGP: 20 (exterior)
EIGRP:90 
OSPF:110
RIP:120
IBGP:200 (interior)

Notes: 
This is pretty basic, there are more verbose explanations, but this is the easiest way I could explain/understand it.
