# CCNA-Notes

These are personal notes some information may not be accurate because I misunderstood the concepts. I've just updated them to Markdown to make them readable. Some sections are incomplete, or missing. Feel free to add if you want, or correct any misconceptions you come across. I apologize for the spelling errors, and not notating where I got the information. A lot of the general explanation is from wikipedia and the actual commands are from cisco documentation.
